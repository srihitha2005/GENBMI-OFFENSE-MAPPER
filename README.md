# GENBMI-OFFENSE-MAPPER
## Description
This project calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and identifies gender using machine learning models. It employs K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for gender classification and Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression for BMI prediction based on facial features.

## Features
- BMI prediction using SVM regression.
- Gender classification using KNN.
- Input: Facial features extracted from images.
- Output: Predicted BMI and identified gender.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy with deep learning models.
- Add real-time video processing support.
